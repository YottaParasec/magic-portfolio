title: "Fail Fast, Learn Faster"
summary: "Building my psychometric MVP taught me that trying, failing, and pivoting quickly delivers more real learning than months of theory. I now see clear value in experimenting early, documenting what didn’t work, and using that as fuel to move on, rather than sinking energy into ideas that don’t stick. Every stumble shortens the distance to what actually works. My new rule: build fast, break things (deliberately), and let each “failed” experiment power up the next iteration."
