## Overview

A collection of individual side projects built to address immediate needs, experiment with automation and analytics, or deepen my understanding of business and urban data. Each project highlights a distinct technical or analytical skill, ranging from web scraping and workflow automation to spatial visualization and investment insights.

## Highlights

### News Aggregator Web App:
Developed a lightweight Flask/MySQL application to aggregate real estate and geopolitical news from multiple sources for personalized dashboard access. Implemented web scraping (BeautifulSoup, requests), database storage, and automated refresh cycles. Built for my own use—now retired.

### Urban Spatial Visualization (Dubai):
Created an interactive map using Folium to visualize Dubai’s city layout, metro lines, and development zones—helping me and others intuitively grasp spatial patterns and urban growth.

### Real Estate Trend Analyzer (Bangalore):
Analyzed private builder transactional data to reveal price trends and percentage appreciation over time—providing actionable insights for investment research.

### PHOTON: AI Desktop Workflow Assistant:
Prototyped a voice-driven AI assistant combining LLaMA-70B and Groq API for speech transcription, task chaining, and workflow automation. Focused on demonstrating local automation—core engine functional, project remains an R&D prototype.

## Technologies Used

- **Python (Flask, Folium, pandas, BeautifulSoup, requests)**: Backend and automation scripting, mapping, and web scraping.
- **MySQL**: Lightweight, programmatic data storage and retrieval.
- **AI & LLMs**: Pilot integration with LLaMA-70B, Groq API for desktop automation and voice commands.
- **Data visualization**: Built-in Python tools and custom dashboards.

## Challenges & Learnings

- Built all tools to solve specific workflow or research problems, often pushing beyond the initial use case
- Balanced quick prototyping with automation, learning to sunset or refine projects as needs changed
- Combined diverse skills: scraping, geospatial mapping, database integration, and AI-driven automation

## Outcome

- Demonstrated fast iteration in diverse technical domains, from news scraping apps to practical AI workflow assistants
- Gained direct experience in automating research, spatial analytics, and business intelligence tasks
- Projects informed my larger analytics and web development work, and continue to influence my approach to new automation challenges
