## Overview

An academic project undertaken to deeply analyze how global commodities—such as crude oil, gold, platinum, silver, copper, and palladium—and US stock indices (notably the NASDAQ 100) move together over time. The goal was to uncover which assets are statistically linked and to understand the economic reasons behind these relationships, ultimately enhancing my own knowledge of macroeconomic and investment strategy.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive statistical exploration of price movements from 2010 to 2024, using cleaned data from Kaggle covering multiple commodities and indices.
- Used Pearson correlation coefficients to reveal significant positive (e.g., NASDAQ & palladium, crude oil & industrial metals) and negative (e.g., US dollar & platinum, US dollar & crude oil) relationships.
- Employed data normalization creatively—not for machine learning, but to allow clear, multi-asset visualizations for side-by-side trend analysis.
- Developed rolling correlations for selected pairs to show how correlation strengths change over economic cycles.
- Presented findings using both Tableau dashboards and Matplotlib/Seaborn visualizations and summarized results in academic presentations and written reports.

## Technologies Used

- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)**: Data preparation, analysis, statistical tests, visualization.
- **Tableau**: Complementary dashboarding and insight sharing.
- **Statistical methods**: Pearson correlation, rolling correlation time series, manual data normalization.
- **Collaborative academic communication**: Preparation of a full report and a professional presentation for university faculty and peer reviewers.

## Challenges & Learnings

- Merging and cleaning heterogeneous financial datasets from different sources, handling nulls and data type conversions.
- Applying creative normalization and rolling window techniques to make noisy or complex data immediately insightful.
- Gained a nuanced appreciation for why certain assets move together—e.g., economic demand, technology sector needs, impacts of currency strength on commodity prices.
- Answers to advanced academic questions built my confidence with statistical argument, and improved my broader understanding of global market dynamics.

## Outcome

- Demonstrated that commodity and equity markets are deeply intertwined—e.g., NASDAQ growth drives palladium demand, while a strong US dollar suppresses prices of many commodities.
- Generated clear actionable visualizations, including pairwise correlation matrices and time-varying correlation plots that explain both short-term and structural relationships.
- The project went beyond assignment requirements, resulting in positive academic feedback and forming a foundation for deeper study (potential for future work in market trend forecasting).
