## Overview

This project started from recognizing the gap between complex high-priced psychometric assessment tools and what small teams or early-stage recruiters actually need. I set out to deliver a focused practical solution: use real scientifically-validated psychometric and cognitive tests and contextualize the results according to specific job descriptions and recruiter insights not a generic scorecard.

Through market research I realized most enterprise solutions are either too broad or too expensive often lacking true relevance for smaller fast-moving organizations. My focus: build something niche lean and grounded in what matters—clear actionable hiring insights.

This journey included mapping pain points via surveys analyzing the limitations of full-stack solutions and gathering feedback from HR professionals an HR consultant and my university’s organizational psychology faculty (including both a professor and the dean each PhDs in the field). Their candid advice shaped the logic and real-world value of the product. The plan is to pilot the tool at the university with support from these academic mentors validating its effectiveness before scaling up.

## Key Features

- **Validated psychometric and cognitive tests**: Built on established research-backed assessments for scientific accuracy.
- **Contextual narrative insights**: Results are interpreted with reference to job descriptions and recruiter notes providing rich feedback on each candidate.
- **Mini case studies per candidate**: The platform produces an AI-generated summary for every applicant—how they answered what it means and where they fit best.
- **Light functional dashboard**: For piloting a MVP admin panel supports test administration and candidate result tracking.

## Technologies Used

- **Python & Django REST Framework**: Robust backend API development and workflow automation.
- **Bootstrap & HTML/CSS**: Minimal responsive interface for piloting and result display.
- **Groq API (LLM)**: AI-powered narrative summaries and logic integration.
- **pandas & NumPy**: Efficient data processing and analysis.
- **Human-centered UX**: Survey-driven research requirements gathering and interviews with HR and psychology experts to ensure relevance.
- **Dashboards**: Real-time monitoring and administration tools for easy piloting.

## Challenges & Learnings

- Building this project solo meant facing bottlenecks in both speed and decision-making. Finding reliable team members remains a key future goal.
- Learned to launch quickly and iterate perfectionism slowed down the MVP stage and early piloting revealed issues faster than hours of private tinkering would have.
- Optimizing data structure and backend logic was necessary to keep the tool efficient and scalable not just functional.
- Validated that user waitlists and market feedback should come before heavy investment in new features.
- Found that industry white papers and consulting reports are invaluable for identifying where market pain points actually are and how to prioritize improvements.

## Outcome

- Actionable mini-case studies for every candidate providing recruiters with clear strengths potential concerns and job fit beyond basic test scores.
- Ranked candidate lists that are transparent and narrative-driven making decision-making faster and more evidence-based.
- Red flags and high-potential signals are surfaced supporting higher confidence for HR and hiring managers.
- **Project status**: Backend is approximately 70 percent complete and the tool is planned for piloting within a department.
