## Overview

Collaborated on an international academic research project examining how weather conditions influence mood and sociability across diverse demographic groups. Conducted during my undergraduate studies in Italy (University of Padova), the project focused on mapping both universal and culturally specific mood-weather links—combining rigorous survey design, cross-cultural analytics, and synthesis of behavioral science findings.

## Key Features

- **Hypothesis-driven analysis**: Tested whether weather affects mood, with an emphasis on individual and cultural differences (e.g. do people from colder climates react differently than those from sunnier regions?)
- **Survey design & implementation**: Led data collection for a large, multinational sample (252 respondents), capturing demographics, weather preferences, mood, and sociability on sunny versus rainy days
- **Comprehensive analytics**: Used rating scales and demographic segmentation (age, gender, country), uncovering preference patterns for “summer” and “spring” and elevated social activity on sunnier days
- **Insightful findings**: Confirmed that sunnier, warmer conditions are generally associated with better mood and higher sociability across age, gender, and nationality—though rainy/cloudy days were often linked with relaxation and calm rather than only negative moods

## Technologies Used

- **Survey (Google Forms)**: Online data collection instrument and participant management
- **Python/pandas, Excel**: Data cleaning, demographic analysis, and descriptive statistics
- **Collaborative writing**: Co-authored the field report, highlighting theory, research design, and nuanced group-level findings

## Challenges & Learnings

- Managed recruitment and data collection across nationalities, ensuring diversity in mood-weather analysis
- Balanced scientific rigor with participant engagement, optimizing survey design to reduce fatigue and boost completion rates
- Uncovered the challenge of comparing “seasons” and local weather experiences across countries—recognized as a limitation for future research
- Synthesized behavioral science insights, enhancing both practical understanding and academic communication skills

## Outcome

- Produced an academically robust report demonstrating that weather and mood are interconnected, but with significant individual and cultural variations
- Found universal preference for socializing on sunnier days, but also highlighted that rain/clouds often promote calm and relaxation in many groups
- Contributed to the knowledge base on environmental psychology, and informed further cross-cultural research collaborations
