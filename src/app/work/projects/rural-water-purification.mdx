## Overview

Participated as a hands-on team member during a seven-day field immersion project in ProtoVillage, Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh, focused on rural water purification. The workshop, organized by my university, brought together interdisciplinary teams to design, document, and physically build a filtration system for a local community—offering a practical window into process improvement and real-world collaboration.

## Key Features

- Contributed to the design, assembly, and process documentation of a “Blue Barrel System” water filter using locally sourced materials (HDPE drums, gravel, sand, biochar, plant-based filtration layers)
- Incorporated process improvements in cleaning, assembly, and maintenance, as well as suggestions for operational and sustainability optimizations in the final report
- Applied field-based teamwork, coordination, and reflective reporting to enhance both the project’s effectiveness and learning outcomes for all stakeholders

## Technologies Used

- **Physical system design**: “Blue Barrel” multi-stage filtration with gravel, sand, and biochar
- **Alternative filtration research**: Evaluation of constructed wetlands and advanced “Living Machine” systems for further application
- **Process documentation**: Authored technical and reflective reports on workflow, assembly, and collaborative practices
- **Testing and evaluation**: In-field measurement of TDS reduction and basic water quality outcomes

## Challenges & Learnings

- Navigated the complexities of team-based design and construction under real-world field conditions
- Learned the limitations of natural filtration for TDS and pathogens, prompting the exploration of solar distillation and biochar/plant-based post-treatment for improved outcomes
- Developed soft skills in teamwork, process documentation, and rapid on-site problem solving
- Formulated recommendations for operational improvements and scalable modifications in future deployments

## Outcome

- Successfully built and field-tested a rural water purification system, achieving demonstrable TDS reduction (750 ppm to 420 ppm)
- Delivered technical presentations and reflective process documentation to academic and practitioner audiences
- Enhanced understanding of sustainability, community impact, and the interplay of engineering, teamwork, and process optimization in practical business analysis contexts
