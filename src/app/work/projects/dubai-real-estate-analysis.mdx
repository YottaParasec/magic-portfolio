## Overview

Analyzed Dubai’s transactional residential property data from 2014 to 2024 to identify market trends and strategic investment opportunities. Led a team in a college analytics project—chose this topic to leverage and grow my domain knowledge in the real estate business, where I also contribute to real investment decisions. The primary goal was to uncover key price drivers and active transaction zones through business-friendly analysis and data storytelling.

## Key Features

- In-depth analytics on residential transactions, focusing on factors like prices, locations, room types, and proximity to landmarks and coastlines
- Comprehensive data cleaning and preparation: retained only residential sales, filtered to top 50 areas by transaction volume, managed outliers (z-score filtering), and addressed missing data
- Geospatial mapping: created price per square meter maps, integrating synthetic coordinates for neighborhoods and malls
- Insights delivered through Tableau dashboard visualizations (now retired), team presentation, and finalist report
- Advanced Q&A with evaluators during live presentations, all work completed in a collaborative team setting

## Technologies Used

- **Python, pandas**: Data wrangling, cleaning, and exploratory analysis
- **Tableau**: Visualization and spatial mapping
- **Statistical analysis**: Price trends, z-score outlier management, correlation insights
- **Geospatial data integration**: Mapped landmark and coastline effects on property value
- **Team leadership & collaboration**: Managed project delivery and data-driven storytelling

## Challenges & Learnings

- Navigated a complex real-world dataset which required iterative cleaning to produce reliable results
- Applied real estate domain knowledge to spot pricing errors and interpret value drivers
- Learned geospatial mapping and manual latitude-longitude enrichment of a public dataset
- Presented to external evaluators, developing confidence in professional, business-oriented data storytelling

## Outcome

- Demonstrated that Dubai’s property market most rewards investment near coastlines, major landmarks, and in higher-end residential zones like Palm Jumeirah and Downtown
- Provided clear geospatial visualization of price per square meter, revealing dramatic value differences in the city’s north-south axis and confirming local development patterns
- Enhanced both my technical analytics skillset and sector knowledge, informing future academic and personal work in property markets
- Project findings compiled in a formal presentation and report for university assessment
